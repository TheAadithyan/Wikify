##Wikipedia delivered as a Newsfeed

Wikipedia is the first place I would look at when I want to know more about anything. Like me most of the people end up in Wikepdia at the time of a need. Why are people not visiting Wikipedia for fun like Quora?. [Wikifeedia](http://vishnuks.com/Wikifeedia) was made to fix this problem.

##How it works?

The home page of Wikifeedia consist of a news feed of Featured articles. Featured articles are considered to be the best articles in Wikipedia. As of now there is no API for getting a list of featured articles that changes each time one make a request. To facilitate this I had to to make a new API server along with some Javascript tweaks.

The backend of Wikifeedia can be found [here](https://github.com/hackerkid/Wikifeedia-backend).

##Installation 
```
git clone https://github.com/hackerkid/Wikifeedia/
cd Wikifeedia
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
Now browse to http://localhost:8000 . 

Equivalent python3 command is `python3 -m http.server`
